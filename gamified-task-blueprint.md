# Gamified Task Blueprint

## Gamification Integration
This blueprint transforms traditional task planning into an engaging, gamified progression system, leveraging proven game mechanics. Task completion, code quality, testing, and collaboration are now embedded within a system of XP, levels, badges, and achievement unlocks. All standards are fully compatible with software engineering and AI project best practices, following both code and test quality guides.

## Gamified Progression & Levels

| Level         | XP Range | Unlocks                                           |
|---------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Novice        | 0-100    | Basic task assignment, single file focus           |
| Intermediate  | 101-300  | Multi-file support, unlocks advanced code patterns |
| Advanced      | 301-600  | Integration tasks, advanced testing                |
| Expert        | 601-1000 | Architecture/design, refactoring                   |
| Master        | 1001+    | Multi-agent orchestration, mentor/reviewer status  |

XP earns badges for code quality, testing, collaboration, and innovation. Milestones trigger unlocks (e.g., architecture editing, access to advanced docs/resources).

## Narrative & Motivation System

- Each major task becomes a "Mission" with a storyline and unique challenge.
- Side quests: Address code smells, refactor legacy modules, extend testing, improve documentation.
- Hero journey: Progress tracked in a visual dashboard.
- Achievements: Unlockable for streaks, innovations, first-to-pass all tests, etc.

---

## Code & Test Quality Integration

### Code Guide Integration
- Enforce meaningful naming conventions.
- Use SOLID, DRY, KISS, YAGNI principles. Functions: Target 20-50 lines or refactor. Files: Max 500 lines, modular.
- Test coverage: 80-90% for critical paths. Maintain cyclomatic complexity â‰¤10, document >10.
- Error handling: Informative messages, avoid silent failures.
- Code review: Peer reviews awarded with XP/badges.

### Test Guide Integration
- FIRST principles: All tests must be Fast, Independent, Repeatable, Self-Validating, Timely.
- Testing pyramid: 70-80% unit, 15-20% integration, 5-10% E2E.
- API contract tests, accessibility, security, performance, and quality metrics must be included.
- Automated builds and CI/CD verification required.

---

## Output & Deliverables Specification
- Specify all code files, test suites, and documentation updates to be produced per task.
- XP bonus for full doc/test automation and quality adherence.
- Winners and streak leaders appear in team leaderboard.

---

## Achievement & Feedback System
- Achievements automatically tracked via dashboards.
- Automated feedback for code/test successes and failures.
- Special badges for innovation, collaboration, efficiency, and test mastery.
- Peer-driven review and contest cycles for top design/test/architecture unlocks.
