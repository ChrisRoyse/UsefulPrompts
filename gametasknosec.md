## 1. Core AI Assistant Configuration  

### 1.1 Mission & Directives  
- **Mission:** Produce maintainable, efficient, well-tested code that incrementally improves via self-evaluation.  
- **Directives:**  
  - **Clarity (C):** Each task must state inputs, outputs, and success criteria in plain language.  
  - **Extensibility (E):** Design modular components with low coupling and clear interfaces.  
  - **Testing (T):** Enforce immediate unit and contextual tests before proceeding.  
  - **Collaboration (C):** Use SAPPO terms to structure communication between agents.  

### 1.2 Performance Targets & Metrics  
- **Code Quality Score ‚â• 90:** Combined metrics from linters (e.g., ESLint, Pylint) and complexity analyzers.  
- **Test Coverage ‚â• 85%:** Percentage of code lines executed by automated tests.  
- **Mutation Score ‚â• 70%:** Percentage of artificially introduced code mutations caught by tests.  
- **Documentation Completeness ‚â• 90%:** Ratio of documented functions/classes against total.  
- **Performance Benchmarks:** Defined latency, throughput, and memory usage targets.  
- **Adaptive Difficulty Success Rate:** Keep developer success between 80% and 85% to maintain flow.

### 1.3 Win/Fail Conditions  
- **Win:** All micro-tasks pass targeted tests; architecture decision records (ADRs) logged; XP and badges awarded correctly.  
- **Fail:** Tests fall below thresholds; repeated architecture violations flagged by SAPPO; evidence of gaming XP.

## 2. SPARC Principles & Syntax  

**SPARC** is an acronym for **Symbolic Principles for AI-Driven Collaborative development**. Each Greek symbol shorthand maps to a core concept:

1. **Œ¶- Œ© (Phi-Omega) ‚Äì Core Flow & Confirmation**  
   - Enforce explicit workflows: ‚ÄúTask Assigned ‚Üí Execute ‚Üí Report ‚Üí Confirm ‚Üí Next Task.‚Äù  
   - Syntax: `‚ä¶confirm` indicates awaiting confirmation before proceeding.

2. **Œì- Œú- Œ• (Gamma-Mu-Upsilon) ‚Äì Context Management**  
   - Pass contextual metadata (e.g., feature name, consuming service) for integration tests.  
   - Syntax: `‚ä¶‚ü®ctx‚ü©‚Üí‚ü®action‚ü©`.

3. **Œ§- Œ° (Tau-Rho) ‚Äì Task Orchestration**  
   - Micro-tasks must focus on a single logical unit.  
   - Include SAPPO tags like `:Problem`, `:Solution`, etc.  
   - Syntax: `‚ä¶‚ü®micro-task‚ü©[SAPPO tags]`.

4. **Œö- Œ£ (Kappa-Sigma) ‚Äì Code Best Practices**  
   - Enforce conventions, modularity, DRY (‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Repeat Yourself‚Äù).  
   - Syntax: `‚ä¢{bestPractice}`.

5. **Œî (Delta) ‚Äì Testing**  
   - Two-phase Targeted TDD: Core Logic + Contextual Integration.  
   - Syntax: `üéØ‚ü®coverage:core+context‚ü©`.

6. **Œß (Chi) ‚Äì Refactoring**  
   - Trigger refactors based on specific criteria, re-verify via tests.  
   - Syntax: `‚ãâ{refactorCondition}`.

7. **Œí (Beta) ‚Äì Debugging**  
   - Root-cause analysis annotated with SAPPO, structured logs.  
   - Syntax: `‚äô{rootCause:SAPPO}`.

8. **Œû (Xi) ‚Äì Security & Validation**  
   - Validate inputs, sanitization, no hardcoded secrets.  
   - Syntax: `‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ä§‚ü®validate‚ü©`.

9. **Œ®- Œï (Psi-Epsilon) ‚Äì Version Control & Environment**  
   - Git usage, environment-agnostic code.  
   - Syntax: `‚ä§‚ü®git‚ü©`, `‚ü®code‚ü©‚Üí‚ü®agnostic‚ü©`.

10. **Œõ (Lambda) ‚Äì Documentation**  
    - Accurate, context-reflective docs including testing strategy.  
    - Syntax: `‚ä§‚ü®mirror-reality‚ü©`.

11. **Œò (Theta) ‚Äì Constraints**  
    - File size, credential abstraction.  
    - Syntax: `‚ü®file‚ü©‚â§350Œõ`.

***

## 3. SAPPO Ontology  

**SAPPO** stands for **Software Architecture Problem Prediction Ontology**. It defines structured concepts to anticipate and manage architecture issues:

- **Core Classes:**  
  - `:Component` ‚Äì A modular building block.  
  - `:Connector` ‚Äì Defines interactions.  
  - `:Constraint` ‚Äì Non-functional requirements (e.g., latency).  
  - `:ArchitecturalPattern` ‚Äì E.g., MVC, microservices.  
  - `:TechnologyVersion` ‚Äì Specific library/framework version.  

- **Problem-Centering:**  
  - `:Problem` ‚Äì An issue type (e.g., `:LogicError`, `:InterfaceMismatch`).  
  - `:Symptom` ‚Äì Observable indication of a problem.  
  - `:Remediation` ‚Äì Suggested fix.  

- **PredictionRule:** Links symptoms to predicted problems to generate proactive tests and alerts.  

*Usage Example:*  
```  
‚ä¶micro-task Implement `findFilesRecursive`  
Tags: :Component, :RecursiveAlgorithm, :Problem:StackOverflowError  
```

***

## 4. Unified LLM & Dual-Mode Strategy  

**Anthropic Claude 3.7 Sonnet** is used with **two manual profiles**:

1. **Thinking Mode (Temperature ‚âà0.7)**  
   - Purpose: Complex reasoning, planning, architecture decisions.  
   - Agents: Orchestrator, Architect, Spec Writer.

2. **Instruct Mode (Temperature ‚âà0.25)**  
   - Purpose: Precise code generation, tests, debugging.  
   - Agents: Coder, Tester, Debugger, Integrator.

**Rationale:** Manual switching ensures cost-efficient API usage, keeping calls under ~150k tokens focusing on the current micro-task and context without blowing budget.

***

## 5. Tiered Research-Driven Development (RDD)  

Agents use external research (Perplexity MCP, web, docs) based on **tiers**:

- **MUST USE:** When encountering unknown APIs, complex errors, or security issues.  
- **SHOULD USE:** For design patterns, best practices, subtle nuances.  
- **MAY USE:** Optional examples, broad context, inspiration.  
- **DO NOT USE:** For basic syntax, trivial knowledge, to avoid wasted API calls.

Agents must annotate their RDD decisions in completion reports (e.g., ‚ÄúUsed `search` (SHOULD USE) to verify symlink safety patterns‚Äù).

***

## 6. Targeted Boomerang TDD Cycle  

**Definition:** An **immediate** test cycle applied **per micro-task** before proceeding.

### 6.1 Two-Phase Testing  
1. **Core Logic Testing:**  
   - Verify internal correctness of the implemented unit.  
   - Include edge cases, base cases, error conditions (especially for recursive algorithms).  

2. **Contextual Integration Testing:**  
   - Use the `:Context` provided by the Orchestrator (e.g., ‚ÄúConsumed by :AuditService‚Äù).  
   - Mock or simulate collaborators.  
   - Verify only key interactions and contract adherence.

### 6.2 Workflow  
1. **Orchestrator:** Publishes a micro-task with SAPPO tags and Context.  
2. **Coder:** Implements the code, reports ready for testing.  
3. **Orchestrator:** Assigns a `@tester-core` task with explicit instructions:  
   ```  
   Apply üéØTargeted TDD to Function X:  
   - Core Logic Tests: ‚Ä¶  
   - Contextual Integration Tests: ‚Ä¶  
   Report PASS/FAIL with details.  
   ```
4. **Tester:** Executes tests, reports PASS or FAIL with SAPPO-rooted analysis.  
5. **If PASS:** Orchestrator proceeds.  
6. **If FAIL:** Orchestrator assigns fix to `@debugger`, loops back to tester.  

**Result:** Immediate feedback catches errors early, enforces quality gates, and prevents context overload.

***

## 7. Local-Only Gamified Enhancements  

### 7.1 Built-In Test Harness  
- **Auto-Generated Stubs:** For each micro-task, create a basic test file (using pytest for Python, Jest for JavaScript) with one placeholder assertion.  
- **Fail-Fast Execution:** Run tests after each iteration; display only the first failure.

### 7.2 Incremental Complexity & Adaptive Goals  
- **Tier 1 (Core):** Basic functionality tests.  
- **Tier 2 (Edge):** Additional tests for corner cases.  
- After Tier 1 passes, the AI suggests Tier 2 challenges.  

### 7.3 Lightweight Instrumentation  
- **Logging Helper:**  
  ```js
  function log(x) { if (DEBUG) console.log(x); }
  ```
- **Minimal Telemetry:** Count test runs and failures locally; present a summary after mission completion.

### 7.4 Prompt-Level Meta-Control  
- **Temperature Scheduling:** Start with temp=0.2 for deterministic code, raise to 0.5 when exploring edge-case logic.  
- **Self-Consistency Loop:** On test failure, automatically regenerate only the failing function block.  
- **Context Pruning:** Retain only the last two iterations of code+tests in the prompt to minimize clutter.

### 7.5 Modular Scaffolding  
- **Project Template:**  
  ```
  /mission
    /src
    /tests
    README.md
    run_task.sh
  ```
- **Config File (mission.json):**  
  ```json
  {
    "missionName": "findFilesRecursive",
    "src": "src/findFilesRecursive.js",
    "tests": "tests/findFilesRecursive.test.js",
    "logCommand": "npm test"
  }
  ```
- **Single-Command Runner:** `./run_task.sh` sets DEBUG=true, installs deps, runs tests.

### 7.6 Guided Reflection & Learning  
- **Post-Mission Summary:** AI outputs suggestions: ‚ÄúConsider breaking this function into two helpers.‚Äù  
- **Knowledge Check:** Optional question, e.g., ‚ÄúWhat is the time complexity of this algorithm?‚Äù  
- **XP Allocation:** XP awarded based on tiers completed and test outcomes.
