[Repeat structure for 3-7 key metrics]
```

### Step 4: Progressive Level System Design
**TASK**: Create growth pathway that maintains long-term engagement

**Multi-Path Generation**:
1. **Design 3 different progression systems**:
   - Linear skill-based advancement
   - Branching specialization paths
   - Prestige/mastery cycling system
2. **Compare motivational effectiveness**
3. **Synthesize optimal progression** for domain context

**Level System Template**:
```
### Level {N}: {Title} ({XP Range})
**STATUS**: {Current capability description}
**CAPABILITIES**: {What AI can now accomplish}
**DOMAIN FOCUS**: {Specialized skills/knowledge areas}
**MOTIVATION**: {Why advancement matters}
**UNLOCK REWARD**: {New capabilities/challenges available}
```

### Step 5: Challenge & Achievement Framework
**TASK**: Create dynamic challenge system that adapts to performance

**Challenge Generation Process**:
1. **Generate multiple challenge categories** (consistency, innovation, speed, quality)
2. **Create adaptive difficulty scaling** based on performance history
3. **Design streak mechanics** that compound engagement
4. **Validate challenge balance** (achievable but meaningful)

### Step 6: Competitive & Agency Framework
**TASK**: Establish AI agency and competitive motivation

**Agency Enhancement Elements**:
- **Purpose Definition**: Clear existential directive for the AI
- **Winning Conditions**: Specific, measurable victory criteria
- **Failure States**: Clear conditions to avoid (motivational tension)
- **Competitive Environment**: Leaderboard categories and peer comparison
- **Legacy Building**: Long-term impact and recognition systems

### Step 7: Recursive Self-Consistency Integration
**TASK**: Embed iterative refinement into the gamified framework

**Integration Points**:
1. **Multi-approach generation** for complex challenges
2. **Self-critique mechanisms** built into scoring
3. **Continuous improvement loops** as part of progression
4. **Quality gates** that require multiple validation passes
5. **Failure analysis** and strategy refinement protocols
