### Implementation Guidelines

#### Core Code Quality Standards

Embed guardrails for every task based on proven quality principles:

**Readability and Maintainability:**

- Enforce meaningful naming conventions that clearly describe purpose without requiring comments
- Apply consistent formatting and indentation following established style guides
- Write self-documenting code where structure and naming tell the story
- Avoid deep nesting (max 3-4 levels) to maintain comprehension
- Separate intention from implementation through well-named functions

**Design Principles (SOLID + Supporting Patterns):**

- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each function/class/module has only one reason to change
- **Open-Closed Principle**: Open for extension, closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: Subtypes must be substitutable for base types
- **Interface Segregation**: Many specific interfaces over one general-purpose
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions
- **DRY**: Eliminate code duplication through abstraction and reuse
- **KISS**: Favor simple solutions over complex ones
- **YAGNI**: Don't build features until they're actually needed

**Size and Complexity Constraints:**

- **Functions**: Target 20-50 lines (industry consensus), flag >50 lines for review
  - Martin Fowler approach: Consider refactoring any function >6 lines
  - Complex algorithms exception: May extend to 100-200 lines with justification
- **Files**: Keep under 500 lines with 2-10 cohesive functions
  - Average successful project files: 20-50 lines (Uncle Bob's analysis)
  - Refactor proactively to minimize cognitive load
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**:
  - Maintain â‰¤10 for normal code (considered maintainable)
  - 11-20: Requires documented refactor plan
  - > 20: Block unless mitigation approved
  - > 50: Considered untestable, must be refactored

**Performance and Optimization:**

- Profile before optimizing - use benchmarking to identify actual bottlenecks
- Choose appropriate data structures based on usage patterns
- Avoid premature optimization - focus on algorithms first
- Implement smart caching for frequently used data
- Document performance requirements and constraints

**Security Requirements:**

- **Input Validation**: Validate all data from untrusted sources
- **Output Encoding**: Properly encode all output to prevent injection
- **Least Privilege**: Grant minimum necessary permissions
- **Secure Frameworks**: Use libraries with built-in security features
- **AI Code Review**: Require human-in-the-loop for AI-generated code
- Never log or expose secrets and keys

**Error Handling Excellence:**

- Provide informative, actionable error messages
- Avoid silent failures - log or handle every exception
- Distinguish recoverable from unrecoverable errors
- Implement graceful degradation where possible
- Define error handling architecture (centralized vs distributed)

### Testing Strategy Blueprint

#### FIRST Principles Foundation

Every test must satisfy the FIRST framework:

- **Fast**: Unit tests in milliseconds, integration tests in seconds-minutes
- **Independent**: Standalone execution without order dependencies
- **Repeatable**: Consistent results across environments (eliminate flaky tests)
- **Self-Validating**: Unambiguous pass/fail with proper assertions
- **Timely**: Written with or before code (shift-left approach)

#### Testing Pyramid Distribution

**Optimal layer distribution for balanced coverage:**

- **Unit Tests (70-80%)**:
  - Foundation with numerous fast, isolated tests
  - Target 80-90% code coverage for critical paths
  - Use AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert)
  - Proper mock/stub/spy usage for isolation
  - Single responsibility per test
- **Integration Tests (15-20%)**:
  - Validate component interactions and data flow
  - Test actual database interactions
  - Contract verification for APIs
  - Use test doubles for unreliable dependencies
- **E2E Tests (5-10%)**:
  - Minimal suite covering critical user journeys
  - Focus on essential business functions
  - Cross-browser/platform compatibility
  - Robust selectors to reduce brittleness

#### Quality Standards by Test Type

### Token Management Rules

#### Context Inclusion Strategy:

1. Always include: [List of mandatory context]
